# PyTorch Model Tutorial

This repo shows a dead-simple example of serving a linear regression model with PyTorch.

## The Model

For learning purposes, the "model" is spilt into three concepts:

    - Initial Dataset
    - Training
    - Inference

#### Initial Dataset

The model is trained using an initial dataset generated by `./models/dataset/gen_data.py`.

The data looks like this:

![Dataset](./model/dataset/data.png)

#### Training

The model is trained using `./model/train.py`. The output of the training is a pre-trained serialized model saved in a `.pth` file.

#### Inference

We can now load the model `.pth` file and use it to make predictions. This is done in `./model/inference.py`.

Example:

    ```bash
    $ python model/inference.py
    enter value: 9.2
    prediction:  24.539400100708008
    ```
